# Readme

This repository represents my notes from nearly two years of learning about [EVE Frontier](https://evefrontier.com/en) and Sui. In February 2026 I removed all of the content about Mud and Solidity given CCPs move to the Sui Blockchain. I publish it here under a Creative Commons (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0) License in the hope that new developers can get up to speed with developing for this game as quickly as possible.

## Contributing

I am happy to accept pull requests to this repository under the same CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license. Consider [installing Hugo](https://gohugo.io/installation/) and testing locally with `hugo serve` to ensure formatting is as expected.
