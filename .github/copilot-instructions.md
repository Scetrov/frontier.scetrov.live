# Copilot Instructions for frontier.scetrov.live

This document provides guidance for AI coding agents working on the `frontier.scetrov.live` repository. It outlines the architecture, workflows, and conventions specific to this project to ensure productive contributions.

## Project Overview

This repository contains documentation and resources for developing with the EVE Frontier game, Sui Move, and the Sui Blockchain. The content is organized as a Hugo static site, with Markdown files for content and custom CSS/HTML for styling.

### Key Components

- **Content**: Located in `content/`, this directory contains Markdown files organized by topic.

- **Layouts**: Found in `layouts/`, this directory includes Hugo templates for rendering the site.

- **Static Assets**: The `static/` directory contains fonts, images, and other static files.

- **Public Directory**: The `public/` folder is the output of the Hugo build process.

## Developer Workflows

### Building the Site

- Install Hugo: Follow [Hugo installation instructions](https://gohugo.io/installation/).

- Build the site locally: Run `hugo build`.

- Serve the site locally: Use `hugo serve` to preview changes.

### Debugging Build Issues

- Check the `hugo.toml` configuration file for errors.

- Ensure all Markdown files in `content/` are properly formatted.

- Verify that all referenced assets (e.g., images, CSS) exist in the `static/` directory.

## Project-Specific Conventions

### Content Organization

- Use descriptive filenames for Markdown files (e.g., `getting-started.md`, `debugging.md`).

- Group related content into subdirectories (e.g., `content/debugging/`, `content/develop/`).

### Styling

- Custom CSS files are located in `assets/css/`.

- Follow the existing CSS naming conventions for consistency.

### Licensing

- All contributions must adhere to the Creative Commons (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0) license.

## Integration Points

### External Dependencies

- Hugo: Used for building and serving the site.

- Fonts and images: Stored in the `static/` directory.

### Cross-Component Communication

- Content files reference assets in the `static/` directory.

- Templates in `layouts/` define how content is rendered.

## Examples

### Adding a New Guide

1. Create a new Markdown file in the appropriate `content/` subdirectory.

2. Use front matter to define metadata (e.g., `title`, `date`, `draft`).

3. Add content using Markdown syntax.

### Updating Styles

1. Edit the relevant CSS file in `assets/css/`.

2. Test changes locally using `hugo serve`.

## What to Avoid

- Avoid making breaking changes to the directory structure without proper communication.
- Do not modify the `public/` directory directly; it is generated by Hugo.
- Refrain from using inline styles in Markdown files; use CSS classes instead.
- Under no circumstances should you add or modify any content that violates the CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license.
- Do not include any sensitive or proprietary information in the repository.
- Under no circumstances should you suggest disabling `gpg` signing for commits or tags, if a signing operation fails notify the user to fix their `gpg` setup instead.
- Avoid suggesting anything that might compromise the security or integrity of the repository or systems it interacts with, including circumventing security controls.
