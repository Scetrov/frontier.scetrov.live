If anyone is new to Ethereum Virtual Machine and Solidity I have some resources that I have found useful:

- **[Ethereum Book](https://github.com/ethereumbook/ethereumbook)** - Antonopoulos & Woods is freely available on GitHub, you can also buy it in paperback or as an eBook.
- **Solidity Overview** - Blockchain Council has a [quick writeup](https://www.blockchain-council.org/ethereum/solidity-for-beginners-a-guide-to-getting-started/) on Solidity, it's a five minute read at most.
- **Microsoft Blockchain (Intro Course)** - Microsoft has a [series of short courses](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/shows/beginners-series-to-blockchain/) on Blockchain fundamentals
- **Full Blockchain Development Course** - If you prefer video content then [Cyfrin Updraft](https://updraft.cyfrin.io/) covers everything from basics to DevOps with Foundry and auditing smart contracts.
- It's worth reading through [MUD Documentation](https://mud.dev/introduction) and doing the [Guides](https://mud.dev/guides/hello-world). If you get stuck on a Mud then they have a [Discord](https://discord.gg/latticexyz) Channel named `#mud-help`.
- If you get stuck then ChatGPT/Claude is useful, however the more developer focused [Phind](https://www.phind.com/search?home=true) works best if you ask it full questions.
- If you still need more help then there is always the [Ethereum StackExchange](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/) or [Peeranha](https://www.peeranha.io/).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> There is nothing wrong with ignoring all of these resources and jumping in and having a go, the Smart Object Framework and Mud abstract a lot of the complexity so it's entirely possible to get started with a basic terminal and a text editor, no experience required.

### Learning Pathway

If you have no familiarity with blockchain or solidity then there are some of the Cyfrin Updraft courses that will get you skilled up quickly:

- [**Blockchain Basics**](https://updraft.cyfrin.io/courses/blockchain-basics) - the basics of how blockchain works in practice.
- [**Web3 Wallet Security Basics**](https://updraft.cyfrin.io/courses/web3-wallet-security-basics) - important information about staying safe on chain.
- [**Solidity Smart Contract Development**](https://updraft.cyfrin.io/courses/solidity) - the basics of the language and how to build smart contracts using the Ethereum Remix IDE.
- [**Visual Studio Code Tutorials**](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/getting-started) - a written tutorial on the basics of Visual Studio Code (VSCode), additionally there are a number of [videos](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/introvideos) if you prefer.
- [**Foundry Fundamentals**](https://updraft.cyfrin.io/courses/foundry) - Foundry is the toolchain that Mud uses, a solid understanding of Foundry will teach you a lot about the development workflow.
- [**Introduction to Git and GitHub**](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-git-github) - the basics of using version control, git and GitHub and how to use it to collaborate with others.
- [**Advanced Foundry**](https://updraft.cyfrin.io/courses/advanced-foundry) - goes into much more detail than the previous course, possibly more than you are likely to need with EVE Frontier, but still very useful for debugging.
- [**Full-Stack Web3 Development Crash Course**](https://updraft.cyfrin.io/courses/full-stack-web3-development-crash-course) - provides lots of background information about Nodejs, pnpm, React and Next.js that is important when building dApps.
- [**Fundamentals of ZKPs**](https://updraft.cyfrin.io/courses/fundamentals-of-zero-knowledge-proofs) - a foundation in Zero-Knowledge Proofs, which will be used in EVE Frontier to provide Information Asymmetry.
- [**Smart Contract Security**](https://updraft.cyfrin.io/courses/security) - essential learning to build secure smart contracts, this will help you avoid making common mistakes.
