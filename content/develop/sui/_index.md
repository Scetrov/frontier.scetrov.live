On the 8th October 2025 CCP Games and the Sui Foundation announced their intent to move from the Ethereum Virtual Machine ecosystem to the Sui Ecosystem. In a YouTube Video and a Twitch Stream it was highlighted that whilst this work had started as of the time of the announcement it would not impact Founders Access until Cycle 5 of Era 6 in Q1/2 2026.
