DevSecOps, short for Development, Security, and Operations, is a set of practices that integrates security into the software development lifecycle. It emphasizes collaboration between development, security, and operations teams to ensure that security is a shared responsibility throughout the entire process of software development and deployment. DevSecOps aims to automate security processes and embed security checks into the continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines, allowing for faster and more secure software releases. By adopting DevSecOps practices, organizations can identify and address security vulnerabilities early in the development process, reducing the risk of security breaches and ensuring that applications are secure by design.
