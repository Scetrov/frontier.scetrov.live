Sometimes you will run into problems that you can't solve on your own, when this happens there are several ways to get help from CCP, Lattice or the EVE Frontier Community:

- You may be able to find the answer to your question either in the [official documentation](https://docs.evefrontier.com), [Mud documentation](https://mud.dev/) or this site. Use the search to find a specific error message.
- You can also search the [EVE Frontier Discord](https://discord.gg/evefrontier) and [Lattice's Discord](https://discord.gg/GAtAA6N9) as in many cases others have experienced the same issue.
- CCP Maintain a [#builder-help](https://discord.com/channels/1021714190102175754/1289669595753480242) channel where both CCP and the community frequently answer question.
- Some questions can be aswered by LLMs such as [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/), [Claude](https://claude.ai/) and [Google Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/app).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Malicous users will often use "support threads" to phish information from you, CCP will never ask to see your private key, recovery phrase (also known as a mnemonic phrase), EVE Frontier password, etc. While the risk on a Testnet is lower, it is still good practice to avoid giving out any secret information.
> Mostly any help can be provided without sharing your screen, so you should also be very wary of someone insisting on screensharing or taking control of your computer to help you.

## What Information to Provide

When you post asking for help in Discord, then the following information is important in understanding what you are trying to do and what went wrong:

1. Provide the **full output of the failing command**, this should cover the actuall command, i.e. `pnpm deploy:pyrope`, all the way to the end of the output of that command. Often the same error message is generated by different commands and the resolution is different.
2. Describe what you have done so far, this helps paint a picture of where you have got too, many errors are as a result of missed or mistyped steps.
3. Explain what you are trying to acheive, if you are trying to complete an example, describe that.
4. Document the changes you have made so far, for example if you have changed `.env`, `mud.config.ts` and `constants.sol` then describe these changes, ensure that you remove any private keys before posting.

> [!TIP]
> Get into the habit of replacing private keys, even the anvil ones with some text that describes the key but doesn't reveal it, for example if you are using the Anvil key replace it with `{ SNIP - Local Anvil Key }`; or if you are using your private key replace it with `{ SNIP - Anvil Key from Client }`.
