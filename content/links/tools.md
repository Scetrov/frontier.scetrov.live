Libraries and software to access various different parts of the game, generally either the World API, Blockchain or ResFiles.

> [!WARNING]
> The tools on this page have been developed by third parties and generally require downloading the source code and executing locally, they **may** contain malicious code introduced by a bad actor. While I reviewed these repositories before adding them, I don't check every commit unless I am actively using the tool. It is strongly recommended that you run these tools in a dedicated and isolated Virtual Machine and you take a snapshot of the VM in advance of downloading the tools.
