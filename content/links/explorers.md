Explorers allow us to view data available on-chain, in the world API and extracted from the `ResFiles` helping us to explorer the Frontier in-game:

- [Hegemony Explorer](http://150.136.250.83/gameinfo) - client for the World API.
- [EVE Datacore](https://evedataco.re/) - explore on-chain data and calculate information about distances and fuel.
- [Blueprint Browser](https://frontier-blueprint-browser.netlify.app/) by Murphyslaw

## Spatial Maps

- [Wells Cargo: Stellar Cartography](https://eve.wellscargo.space/) - view points of interest and star systems in 3D.
- [Frontier Atlas](https://frontier-atlas.com/map) - view the map and plot routes in 3D.

## Calculators

- [EVE Frontier Bill of Materials](https://www.efbom.com/) - Explorer Industry within the Frontier
- [EFTB](https://eftb.shish.io/) - various calculators to simplify exploring the Frontier.
