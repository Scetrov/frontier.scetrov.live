Killboards allow players to track activity through the galaxy and in some cases identify fits, capabilities and tactics of other players. There are two primary sources of Kill and Loss information:

- The Chain, and by extension the World API which reads from the chain.
- The Carbon Client itself, specifically by copy / pasting the killmails from the client.
